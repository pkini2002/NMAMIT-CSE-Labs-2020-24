## Part - A Programs

- Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16-bits). 
- Write a program for frame sorting technique used in buffers. 
- Write a program for distance vector algorithm to find suitable path for transmission. 
- Write a program for Hamming Code generation for error detection and correction. 
- Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data 
- Write a program for congestion control using Leaky bucket algorithm.

## Part - B Programs

- Simulate a three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.
- Simulate a four node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows: n0-n2, n1-n2 and n2-n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameter and determine the number of packets by TCP/UDP.
- Simulate the different types of Internet traffic such as FTP a TELNET over a network and analyze the throughput.
- Simulate the transmission of ping messaged over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.
- Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N-nodes (6-10), change error rate and data rate and compare the throughput.
- Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and determine collision across different nodes.
- Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source/destination.
