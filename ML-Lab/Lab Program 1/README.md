## ML Lab Programs

- Write a Python program for the `Chronic disease dataset` and perform the following
  - Analyse and preprocess the data and check if the class label is balanced or not. To balance the class label perform oversampling of minority class
  - Check the outlier using boxplot and remove the outlier using Z-Score method
  - Classify the Chronic disease by using Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest Algorithm and Adaboost Algorithm
  
- Write a Python program for the `Heart disease dataset` and perform the following
  - Analyse and preprocess the data and check if the class label is balanced or not. To balance the class label perform oversampling of minority class
  - Check the outlier using boxplot and remove the outlier using Z-Score method
  - Classify the Heart disease by using Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest Algorithm and Adaboost Algorithm

- Write a Python program to predict the price of the flight using `flight.csv` dataset
  - Analyse and preprocess the data and generate a data correlation heatmap
  - Check the outlier using boxplot and remove the outlier using Z-Score method
  - Build a model using Decision tree regressor, Random Forest regressor and Ada Boost Regressor

- Write a Python program for `Cancer dataset` and perform the following
  - Analyse and preprocess the data and check if the class label is balanced or not. To balance the class label perform oversampling of minority class
  - Check the outlier using boxplot and remove the outlier using Z-Score method
  - Classify the dataset using Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Algorithm
